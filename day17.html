<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 17: No Such Thing as Too Much ---</h2><p>The elves bought too much eggnog again - <code>150</code> liters this time.  To fit it all into your refrigerator, you'll need to move it into smaller containers.  You take an inventory of the capacities of the available containers.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you have containers of size <code>20</code>, <code>15</code>, <code>10</code>, <code>5</code>, and <code>5</code> liters.  If you need to store <code>25</code> liters, there are four ways to do it:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>15</code> and <code>10</code></li>
<li><code>20</code> and <code>5</code> (the first <code>5</code>)</li>
<li><code>20</code> and <code>5</code> (the second <code>5</code>)</li>
<li><code>15</code>, <code>5</code>, and <code>5</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Filling all containers entirely, how many different <em>combinations of containers</em> can exactly fit all <code>150</code> liters of eggnog?</p>

<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>1638</code>.</p><p class="day-success">The first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: *</p>
<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Part Two ---</h2><p>While playing with all the containers in the kitchen, another load of eggnog <span title="Apparently, Amazon ships to the North Pole now.">arrives</span>!  The shipping and receiving department is requesting as many containers as you can spare.</p>
<p>Find the minimum number of containers that can exactly fit all <code>150</code> liters of eggnog.  <em>How many different ways</em> can you fill that number of containers and still hold exactly <code>150</code> litres?</p>
<p>In the example above, the minimum number of containers was two.  There were three ways to use that many containers, and so the answer there would be <code>3</code>.</p>
